# YAML Transformer [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

This project built on a draft version of the OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML, even before version 1.0.
Meanwhile, [OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML Version 1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.html) is released.
So, this proejct can be seen as technology study, but is far away from any use in practise.

## Documentation
Documentation is published at https://github.com/CloudCycle2/YAML_Transformer/wiki and https://github.com/CloudCycle2/YAML_Transformer/tree/master/Documentation.
The wiki includes many things about all project aspects whereas the documentation folder contains how a YAML document is transformed to XML.
This is important if you want to use the YAML Transformer and would like to know the representation of YAML elements in XML.
